\chapter{Users Perspective}
\label{ch:lit_rev}
	\section{Introduction}
		In this Section we will provide a useful manual for the end-users of our system. 
	\section{Our Users}
		In Chapter \ref{1} we briefly mentioned our system's purpose as ...
		\begin{mydef}
			An AI-assisted decision making system for thyroid nodule classification.
		\end{mydef}
		As we are going to see later, various scientific methods are applied, taking into account 
		multiple parameters, in order to produce a probabilistic result. This fact implies that the
		end-user will be an expert on Radiology, to understand the terms, and carefully interpret the 
		results. From now on we assume that our system users will be experianced Radiologists
