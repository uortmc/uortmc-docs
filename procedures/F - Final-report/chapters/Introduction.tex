Deep learning has found numerous applications in the health care community. Recently, a massive explosion of research on the relevant field, 
driven by large amounts of available data, has generated important disease prevention and identification results.[\cite{ai-applications}] \par

The Dominant process for thyroid nodule identification and classification is called FNA (or Fine Needle Aspiration/Biopsy). 
FNA is an expensive process requiring expensive lab equipment and specialized personnel.[\cite{fna-proccess}]\par

There is no way to determine the category of a thyroid nodule apart from performing FNA on a sample. Our vision is to create an application to act as a bridge between the academic community working on theoretical deep learning models to predict a
nodule's category and the radiologists working with actual patients and real data. Our hope is that by establishing a common language(the application) 
we will improve the research process as experimental models will work on accurate nodule scans, providing instant feedback to the researchers for further analysis.\par

Our system needs to be as generic as possible to support any prediction model, reliable and easy to maintain and expand. 
It needs to be optimized to handle the deep learning models and finally needs to be as secure as possible because it will handle actual patients and sensitive data.\par
