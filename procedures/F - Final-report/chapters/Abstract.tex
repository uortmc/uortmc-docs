Deep learning has found numerous applications in the health care community. Recently, a massive explosion of research on the relevant field, 
driven by large amounts of available data, has generated important disease prevention and identification results. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) 
is the dominant procedure for thyroid nodule classification. FNA has associated risks and expenses, and in this project,
we will try to reduce both using the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Our primary goal is to 
bring closer the radiologists 'on the field' with those complex algorithms and provide value to real patients by providing an interface, 
in the form of a web application, for probabilistically predicting the severity and the category of a given module.
