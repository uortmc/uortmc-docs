Fine Needle Aspiration(FNA/Biopsy) is the method of choice for thyroid nodule classification; it requires specialized hardware and software
and expensive labs and trained personnel to be performed. Recent advances in Artificial intelligence and machine learning had given rise to numerous 
experimental classification models for thyroid nodules that can perform classification and categorization at a
fraction of the cost of the classic FNA method. Currently, there is no way of reliably testing this model on real conditions with actual patients. 
In this report, we will develop an AI-assisted decision-making system that acts in between the researcher and the radiologist, making access to advanced 
deep learning models easier. The application is also capable of receiving feedback about the
model's prediction, giving essentially a feedback line between the doctor and the researcher/model developer, the feedback as well as the data
collected may then be used for the development of better classification methods and techniques.
