\chapter*{\center \Large  Acknowledgments}

I would like at this point to thank my supervisor, Mrs. Huizhi Liang, for her help, guidance, and support during the design, development, and testing
of this system; her enthusiasm, knowledge, and exacting attention to detail have been an inspiration and kept my work on track from the first
encounter until the very last day. I would also like to thank my Beloved Magdalene and my dear friend Nicolas; without their endless support, the completion of this project 
would not be possible.
